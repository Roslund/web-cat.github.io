Mobile application development in general, and the Android platform in
particular, are hot topics among educators because of their power to
motivate and engage students. Unfortunately, Android's software API is
not designed for beginners and presents a number of stumbling blocks to
classroom use. **Sofia, the Simple Open Framework for Inventive Android
Applications**, is a new abstraction layer over the Android API
that provides a cleaner, simpler, easier to use API for beginners and
professionals alike. It includes a novel event dispatch design that
eliminates the glue code required by more conventional frameworks,
provides a powerful 2D shape package with declarative animation support
and physics simulation, streamlines the process of writing
multi-activity apps for Android, and addresses a number of other issues
that make Android hard to use in introductory courses.
