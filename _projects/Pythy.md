**Pythy: The Cloud-Based IDE for Novice Python Programmers**
is a web-based programming environment for Python that
**eliminates software-related barriers to entry** for
novice programmers, such as installing the language runtime and IDE
and properly configuring other dependencies. Within seconds, students can
begin **writing code, watch it execute, debug it, and access support materials and tutorials**,
all from within the familiar context of their **web browser**.
